# CV Placeholder

This is a placeholder for Huseyin Melih Celik's CV.

In a real portfolio, you would place a PDF version of your resume here at `/public/cv.pdf`.

## How to add your CV:

1. Create your CV as a PDF file
2. Name it `cv.pdf` 
3. Place it in the `public` folder
4. The download link will automatically work

The current portfolio is configured to download from `/cv.pdf` which maps to `public/cv.pdf`.
